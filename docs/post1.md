What are we making?

I'm making an app to easily track symptoms related to PMS and PMDD without distractions and in a way that is less overhwelming than seeing all the questions at once. Should eventually be able to export that data in a way that is useful to ones doctor. Want a CLI as well as a web-based GUI.
