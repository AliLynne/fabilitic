I really like to get down to first principles when I learn how to do something. Not right away, but after I've done a few tutorials, I like to make sure I understand how the nuts and bolts fit together. So that's what I'm going to try to do with this project.

I want to do a multi-part series on building this project from the 'ground up.' Starting with what is meant by 'the ground' here. I like to look at things from a 'How would I teach this?' perspective. Which means thinking about who I'm teaching. In this case, people who have done a few tutorials with the MERN stack and now want to dig down a bit deeper and really understand what's going on with each item we type. 

So step one: make a list of posts that seem logical.
1.  What are we making?
2.  What are we working with here? Node, Express, Mongo, Mongoose, CLI (Give definitions, include diagrams, how does each piece work with the others?)
3.  Getting started. What's the least you need to get started? (I think starting with package.json is a good place) What is package.json? What does it do? What things do we need to have in place before we can move on?
4.  Push to Git early!!
5.  TEST EARLY!!

Steps I've actually taken: 
1. npm init
2. install mongoose
3. install mocha
4. setup mocha
5. test_helper.js
6. Got annoyed and installed nodemon
7. Express Install!
